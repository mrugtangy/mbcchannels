<h3>FAQ</h3>
</center>

###### How can I play the playlist?

You can use softwares such as [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) (With IPTV Plugin), [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc), [IPTVnator](https://github.com/4gray/iptvnator) or any other IPTV/M3U player if you're on Windows, Linux or MacOS as long as it supports the usage of m3u link or m3u file.

For Android, You can use [VLC for Android](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html), [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/download/android) (With IPTV Plugin), [Sparkle TV](https://sites.google.com/view/sparkleplayer/) (Recommended for Android TV) or any other IPTV/M3U Player as long as it supports the usage of m3u link or file.

###### How did you find the streaming links for the channels?

Well, I used HttpCanary on an Android phone to be able to get the links.

Why So? Well, In older versions of MBC Play App, The streaming links to each channels were in the app's code. But in newer versions, the new links were completely removed from the app's code and I wasn't able to find it. This is when I had the idea to use HttpCanary as it is used to analyse any traffic passing though it's Local VPN (pretty much a packet sniffer but for Android).

But I faced some issues when using the app. Firstly, I wasn't able to analyse the traffic of the MBC Play app since I needed to install HttpCanary's Certificate as root so that I can analyse encrypted packets or something like that since the app was using it to access the streaming links. And secondly, I needed root access to do it and the MBC Play App was refusing to launch due to root and also, wasn't functioning properly when safetynet was failling to pass.

Thankfully, I had a device with Magisk installed (root) and as a workaround, I use a module to successfully pass safetynet and I hid root access from the app so that it doesn't detect it.

And finally, I was able to launch the app and then, I played every channel on it and all the streaming links were sniffed by HttpCanary.

###### Can you please integrate TV Guide (EPG) in it?

Unfortunately, I haven't found any link to their EPG yet. But, I might find it in the future if I try or if they add it on the app.

<h3>Note</h3>
</center>

Some channels such as ZOOM or other cannot be added since it's not present in MBC Play. But do note that TV5Monde/TIVI5 is streamed on MBC 17 and is included.

However, these channels might be present in public IPTV playlists found on GitHub or any other places where you can expect to find an IPTV playlist that's pirated. But do note that I don't promote piracy and use these playlists on your own responsibility.
