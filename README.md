### Streaming links for TV/Radio channels found in the MBC Play app


This will allow you to watch these TV channels and Stream radio channels for free on any device, Even your smart tv!

## NOTE : 
#### THESE STREAMING LINKS ARE COMPLETELY HIDDEN IN THE APP'S CODES! I WAS ABLE TO DECRYPT THE LINKS USING AN APP CALLED HTTPCANARY, WHICH IS USED TO ANALYSE THE TRAFICS SENT BY ANDROID APPS!

## Requirements :-

Laptop or Desktop with Windows XP/7/8/10 or An android device with with Android 8+ such as a Smartphone, Tablet or a Smart TV

VLC media player/Any IPTV APP*/Any browser(Android only)

A good internet connection

*Do not use IPTV smarters pro for PC since it asks for Username and password, which is not required to stream these channels. It's required and there's no way of bypassing it unless, you buy a subscription from a reseller. You can use the Android app since it allows you to add an m3u8 playlist!
