Please note that other channels streamed by  are not available becauce those are not from MBC and are provided by other TV companies. For example, ZOOM is provided by the Indian TV company. 

If you wish to access these channels, please look for other IPTV playlists available on GitHub. An example is [this one](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv). Some channels might not works as some of them are outdated.

**Rodrigues FM is only accessible in Rodrigues!**

These playlists can be used on IPTV apps that allows you to use a m3u playlist or any m3u playlist player. Apps that I recommend are [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/download/) (With IPTV extension) and [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). These two are free and available on Android/Android TV, Windows, Linux and macOS!
